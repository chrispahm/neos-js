"________________________________________________________\n    \n                    WELCOME TO NEOS!\n    \n            The Network-Enabled Optimization System\n\n                       developed by\n    \n            The Optimization Technology Center of\n    Argonne National Laboratory and Northwestern University\n    ________________________________________________________\n    \n    \n    I. ABSTRACT\n    \n    This server accepts optimization problems sent electronically, and \n    solves them using the computing facilities of the Optimization \n    Technology Center and other participating hosts. The user can obtain\n    information on the optimization problem, the solution process, and\n    the solution. Further, users can register their own software with\n    this server, making their code available to other users.\n    \n    This server is under construction.  Comments and suggestions should\n    be sent to support@neos-server.org. \n    We have assumed familiarity with basic optimization terminology.  If \n    you need additional information, consult\n\n    J. More' and S. Wright,\n    Optimization Software Guide,\n    SIAM Publications, 1993.\n\n\n\n    II.
