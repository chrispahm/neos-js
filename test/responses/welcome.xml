            The Network-Enabled Optimization System

    I. ABSTRACT
    
    This server accepts optimization problems sent electronically, and 
    solves them using the computing facilities of the Optimization 
    Technology Center and other participating hosts. The user can obtain
    information on the optimization problem, the solution process, and
    the solution. Further, users can register their own software with
    this server, making their code available to other users.
    
    This server is under construction.  Comments and suggestions should
    be sent to support@neos-server.org. 
    We have assumed familiarity with basic optimization terminology.  If 
    you need additional information, consult

    J. More' and S. Wright,
    Optimization Software Guide,
